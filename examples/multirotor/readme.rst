Overview
---------------------------------------------

Multiple drone models to demonstrate various capabilities of fmdtools.

Models
/////////////////////////////////////////////


- `drone_mdl_static.py`: Base drone model file with very simple static behaviors

- `drone_mdl_dynamic.py`: Extended drone model with dynamic behavior

- `drone_mdl_hierarchical.py`: Extended drone model with component architectures

- `drone_mdl_rural.py`: Extended drone model flying in a rural environment

- `drone_mdl_urban.py`: Extended drone model flying in an urban environment

Scripts and tests:
/////////////////////////////////////////////

- `test_multirotor.py`: Tests various drone behaviors


Notebooks
/////////////////////////////////////////////

The multirotor example model has several models of drones modeled at differing levels of detail which are then used in the following example notebooks;

- `fmdtools Paper Demonstration <Demonstration.ipynb>`_  is helpful for understanding how a model can be matured as more details are added, covering:

  - The :mod:`fmdtools.analyze.graph` module.
  
  - Basic simulation of dynamic and static models using methods in :mod:`fmdtools.sim.propagate` and usage of class :class:`fmdtools.sim.sample.SampleApproach` for fault sampling
  
  - Analysis using Basic analysis/results processing capabilities
 
- The `Urban Drone Model <drone_mdl_urban.py>`_ is helpful for understanding how to set up gridworlds using :class:`fmdtools.define.object.coords.Coords` and an Environment class. `Urban Drone Demo <Urban_Drone_Demo.ipynb>`_ demonstrates how this gridworld can be used in simulation.
 
- `Multirotor Optimization <Multirotor_Optimization.ipynb>`_ shows how the design, operations, and contingency management of a system can be co-optimized with the :class:`fmdtools.sim.search.ProblemArchitecture` class. 

- The support files include various implementations of the drone model.

  - `drone_mdl_static.py` is the baseline model of the drone for static modeling that is used in the other models.

  - `drone_mdl_dynamic.py` expands on the static model to allow for dynamic simulation. It generates behavior-over-time graphs and dynamic/phase-based FMEAs. 

  - `drone_mdl_hierarchical.py` is used to compare system architectures. First by seeing how faults effect the behaviors in each architecture, then by seing how it affects the overall system resilience.

  - `drone_mdl_opt.py` is a modified version of the hierarchical done that encompasses autonomous path planning, rotors, electrical system, and control of the drone. It is parameterized with the following parameters: The rotor and battery architecture can be changed, the flight height can be changed to support different heights, which in turn changes the drone's flight plan, and there is now a `ManageHealth` function which reconfigures the flight depending on detected faults.
