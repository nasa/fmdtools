fmdtools at OSU
-------------------------

Prior to fmdtools being developed at NASA, it was a project in the Design Engineering Lab at Oregon State University ([available here](https://github.com/DesignEngrLab/fmdtools)), which was conceptualized in this initial paper by Daniel Hulse, Hannah Walsh, Andy Dong, Christopher Hoyle and Irem Tumer (at OSU) and Chetan Kulkarni and Kai Goebel (at NASA). Special thanks to Arpan Biswas and Hongyang Zhang also for working on some case studies in the repository.
