# Intro to resilience modelling, simulation, and visualization in Python with fmdtools.
### Author: Daniel Hulse 
### Version: 2.0-alpha

-----------------

# Overview

- **Overview of fmdtools**
    - Purpose
    - Project Structure
    - Common Classes/Functions
    - Basic Syntax
- **Coding Activity**
    - Example model: [`examples/pump/ex_pump.py`](../examples/pump/ex_pump.py)
    - Workbook: [`examples/pump/Tutorial_unfilled.ipynb`](../examples/pump/Tutorial_unfilled.ipynb)
        - Model Instantiation
        - Simulation
        - Visualization/Analysis

-----------------
# Prerequisites

- Ideally, some pre-existing Python and Git knowledge
- Anaconda distribution 
    - Ideally this is already set up!
    - Download/install from: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
- A git interface
    - [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (graphical git environment)
    - [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/) (stand-alone CLI)

-----------------
# Motivation: Modelling System Resilience

Resilience means taking a **dynamic understanding of risk and safety**

![resilience idea](/docs/figures/resilience_idea.png)

-----------------
# Why is Resilience Important?

![resilience importance](/docs/figures/resilience_importance.png)

-----------------
# Enabling proactive design process

![width:900px](/docs/figures/resilience_design.png)

- Especially relevant to **new systems** when **we don’t have data** 

-----------------

# Why fmdtools? Possible Competitors:

- Uncertainty Quantification tools:  (e.g. OpenCossan)
    - Doesn’t incorporate fault modelling/propagation/visualization aspects
- MATLAB/modelica/etc. Fault Simulation tools
    - Rely on pre-existing model/software stack--Useful, but often difficult to hack/extend (**not open-source**)
- Safety Assessment tools: (e.g. Alyrica, Hip-Hops)
    - Focused on quantifying safety, not necessarily resilience 
    - As a result, use **different model formalisms**!

-----------------

# Why fmdtools? Pros:

- Highly Expressive, modular model representation.
    - faults from any component can propagate to any other connected component via **undirected propagation**
    - highly-extensible code-based behavior representation
    - class structure enables **complex models** representing human behavior and systems of systems
- Research-oriented:
    - Written in/relies on the Python stack
    - Open source/free software
- Enables design:
    - Models can be parameterized an optimized!
    - Plug-and-play analyses and visualizations

-----------------

# Why **not** fmdtools? Cons:

- You already have a pre-existing system model
    - fmdtools models are built in fmdtools
    - if you have a simulink/modelica model, you may just want to use built-in tools

- You want to use this in production 
    - fmdtools is Class E Software and thus mainly suitable for research (or, at least, we don't gaurantee it)
    - Somewhat dynamic development history

-----------------

# What is fmdtools? A Python package for **design**, **simulation**, and **analysis** of resilience.

# Analysis Workflow/Structure

![Analysis Workflow](/docs/figures/workflow.png)

-----------------

# Defining a Model

- What do we want out of a model?
    - What behaviors and how much fidelity do we need?
    - What functions/components and interactions make up the system?
        - Single function or multiple functions?
        - Is it controlled? Are there multiple agents?
- What type of simulation do we want to run?
    - Single-timestep vs multi-timestep vs network 
- What scenarioss do we want to study and how?
    - Failure modes and faulty behaviors
    - Disturbances and changes in parameters
    - What are the possible effects of hazards and how bad are they? 
        - By what metrics?

-----------------

# Defining a Model

![formalism example](/docs/figures/formalism_example.png)


-----------------
# Demo Model Activity: examples/pump/ex_pump.py

Notice the definitions and structure:
- **States**: `WaterStates`, `EEStates`, `SignalStates`
- **Flows**: `Water`, `EE`, `Signal`
- **Functions**: `ImportEE`, `ImportWater`, `ExportWater`, `MoveWater`, `ImportSignal`
    - **Flows**
    - **Modes** (e.g., `ImportEEMode`, `ImportSigMode`)
        - Mode probability model
        - Actual modes in `faultparams` entry
    - others attributes, e.g., `Timer`
- **Model**: `Pump` connects functions, flows, and defines `end_classification`
- **Parameter**: `PumpParam` defines values we can change in the simulation

-----------------

# More Resources for Model Definition

- Note the docs for model definition in https://nasa.github.io/fmdtools/docs/fmdtools.define.html

- Other examples also can be helpful: https://nasa.github.io/fmdtools/docs/Examples.html

-----------------

# Notebook Activity:

Open `/examples/pump/Tutorial_unfilled.ipynb`:
- Instantiate the model
    - `mdl = Pump()`
- Explore structure
    - Try different parameters! 
    - Change things!
    What does the model directory look like? 
    - `dir(mdl)`

-----------------

# Simulation Concepts: Static/Undirected Propagation

![Static Propagation](/docs/figures/propagation.png)

In a single timestep:
- Functions with `static_behavior()` methods simulate until behaviors converge (i.e., no new state values)
- Functions with `dynamic_behavior()` run once in defined order

-----------------

# Simulation Concepts: Propagation over Time

![Dynamic Propagation](/docs/figures/propagationovertime.png)

- Model increments (simulated + history updated) over each time-step until a **defined final time-step** or **specified indicator returns true**. 

-----------------

# Simulation Concepts: Types of Simulations

![Dynamic Propagation](/docs/figures/simulation_types.png)

For more info, (syntax/arguments), see documentation for [`fmdtools.sim.propagate`](https://nasa.github.io/fmdtools/docs/fmdtools.sim.html#fmdtools-sim-propagate)

-----------------

# Simulation Concepts: Sampling Approaches

These classes define **multi-run simulations** which can be used to quantify uncertain performance/resiliences:

- **SampleApproach**: Which faults to sample and when
    - Relies on **mode** information encoded in the model
    - Simulated using `propagate.approach()`

- **NominalApproach**: Nominal parameters or random seeds to sample
    - Can be simulated in `propagate.nominal_approach()`
    - Can be simulated in conjunction with faults using `propagate.nested_approach`

See docs for: [`fmdtools.sim.approach`](https://nasa.github.io/fmdtools/docs/fmdtools.sim.html#module-fmdtools.sim.approach)

-----------------

# Simulation Concepts: Things to Consider

**Static/Dynamic propagation:** How function states propagate to each other in a single time-step and multiple time-steps
- Undirected graph representation—states can effect all other connected states, and vice versa, in any order

**Stochastic Propagation:** Whether and how stochastic states are instantiated over time
- e.g. do we run with the “default” values of parameters, or do we sample from a random number generator?

**Breadth of Scenarios:** How hazards are represented as discrete scenarios to simulate
- What set of joint faults do we use? How many times are sampled?
- Operational scenarios and joint operational/fault scenarios

-----------------

# Activity: Simulate the Model

Run fault propagation methods:
- `propagate.nominal()`
- `propagate.one_fault()`
- `propagate.approach()`

What do the results look like? Explore data structures:
- `analyze.result.Result`
- `analyze.result.History`

Explore:
- What happens when you change `SampleApproach` parameters?
- What happens when you change `Model` parameters?
- How do these methods compare in terms of computational time?

-----------------

# Analysis Modules

![Analyze Modules width:960px](/docs/figures/analyze_module_structure.png)

See docs for: [`fmdtools.analyze`](https://nasa.github.io/fmdtools/docs/fmdtools.analyze.html)

-----------------

# Analysis Activity

**Visualize the results:**
- Show model graph
- Show nominal performances
- Show performances in a nominal scenario
- Make a scenario-based fmea

**Explore:**
- How can you show only the parameters you want? Or change the formatting?
- What does the behavior under other faults look like?
- What other analyses can you perform with these results?

-----------------

# Conclusions/Summary

- **fmdtools** is an environment for designing resilient systems
    - `/define` enables model definition
    - `/sim` is used to define simulations
    - `/analyze` is used to analyze and visualize simulation results
- I hope you agree that it has some powerful features!
    - Modelling expressiveness and clarity
    - Types of simulations that can be run
    - Powerful but easy-to-leverage plug-and-play analyses
