**fmdtools** (Fault Model Design tools) is a toolkit for modelling system resilience in the early design phase. With it, one can simulate the effects of faults in a system to build resilience into the system design at a high level.  To achieve this, fmdtools provides a Python-based *design environment* where one can represent the system in a model, simulate the resilience of the model to faults, and analyze the resulting model responses to iteratively improve the resilience of the design.

For full reference and examples, please see the [documentation page](https://nasa.github.io/fmdtools/).

Note: This version (**2.0-alpha**) is currently in development, and thus not all interfaces may be fully stable and not all examples or documentation may be up-to-date.

For stable versions, download packages releases without the -alpha or -beta tags.
