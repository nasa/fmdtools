    Superclass for components (most attributes inherited from Block superclass).

    Components may be called from external Component Architectures or on their own.

    Typically, components are meant to represent physical realizations of systems
    that maybe multifunctional.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> c = ExampleComponent()
    >>> c
    examplecomponent ExampleComponent
    - t=Time(time=-0.1, timers={})
    - s=ExampleState(x=np.float64(0.0), y=np.float64(0.0))
    >>> c()
    >>> c
    examplecomponent ExampleComponent
    - t=Time(time=1.0, timers={})
    - s=ExampleState(x=np.float64(2.0), y=np.float64(1.0))
    >>> c()
    >>> c
    examplecomponent ExampleComponent
    - t=Time(time=2.0, timers={})
    - s=ExampleState(x=np.float64(2.0), y=np.float64(2.0))

    Calling a particular propagation step individually only runs the given behavior
    method (in this case, dynamic and not static).

    >>> c(proptype="dynamic")
    >>> c
    examplecomponent ExampleComponent
    - t=Time(time=3.0, timers={})
    - s=ExampleState(x=np.float64(2.0), y=np.float64(3.0))

    Note that we can also simulate to a given time, which should give the same results.
    >>> c2 = ExampleComponent()
    >>> c2(time=2.0)
    >>> c2
    examplecomponent ExampleComponent
    - t=Time(time=2.0, timers={})
    - s=ExampleState(x=np.float64(2.0), y=np.float64(2.0))
