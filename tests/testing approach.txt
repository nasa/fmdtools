Models tested:
[x] eps
	- [x] undirected propagation 
	- [x] static use-cases
		- [x] length 1 history
		
[x] pump
	- [x] dynamic response is as predicted
	- [x] model copy
	- [x] model reset
[x] pump_stochastic
	- [x] test seed generation
	- [x] summary stats are within bounds
	- [x] identical seeds replicate behavior
	- [x] copied models replicate behavior ,etc
[x] hold-up tank
	- [x] test components 
		- [x] mode propagation up/down the hierarchy
		- [x] copy/reset/etc
	- [x] he probability model
[ ] drone
	- network methods??
	- static 
	- test components (same as hold-up tank)
[ ] pandemic
	- migrate to unittest
	
[ ] leverage inheritance for tests to apply to all test-cases
