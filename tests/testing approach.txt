Models tested:
[ ] eps
	- [x] undirected propagation 
	- [x] static use-cases
		- [x] length 1 history
		
[ ] pump
	- dynamic response is as predicted
	- model copy/reset
[ ] pump_stochastic
	- test seed generation
	- summary stats are within obunds
	- copied models replicate behavior
	- identical seeds replicate behavior
[ ] hold-up tank
	- test components 
		- mode naming
		- mode propagation up/down the hierarchy
		-copy/reset/etc
	- he probability model
[ ] drone
	- network methods??
	- static 
	- test components (same as hold-up tank)
[ ] pandemic
	- migrate to unittest
